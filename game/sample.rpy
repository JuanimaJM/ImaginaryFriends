    Day 1\n
    Entry 1: Our New Home\n
    We just got to our new house.
    It looked like a really big house with many rooms.
    There was even an apple tree in the backyard with a swing. 
    I felt excited upon seeing it.\n
    Entry 2: The Walls Have Eyes\n
    I feel like the walls have eyes. 
    Wherever I go, I feel something is watching me. 
    It’s scary, this feeling is scary. 
    But, I guess it’s better than always hearing Mom yell angrily.\n
    Entry 3: The Call From The Dark Room\n
    As I walk to the hall, I sense someone looking at me. 
    It was behind the slightly opened room on my left. 
    It was dark, I couldn’t see anything. 
    But I heard something. 
    A whisper, someone calling me.
    I met them, a friend who always gave me advice.\n
    Entry 4: The Idols\n
    I met two idols when I was walking down the stairs. 
    One was a cat, the other, a dog. 
    Both always sung the words they say. 
    They were really entertaining and fun to talk with.
